#### I successfully executed a comprehensive SQL project focusing on a amazon sales dataset. The dataset included essential information such as product ID, product name, category, discounted price, actual price, discount percentage, rating, and rating count. Leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, I extracted valuable insights and provided meaningful answers to a few related questions.I consider this as a mini project , did this for practising sql queries.
