# Product-Analysis
## Introduction
#### I successfully executed a comprehensive SQL project focusing on a amazon sales dataset. The dataset included essential information such as product ID, product name, category, discounted price, actual price, discount percentage, rating, and rating count. Leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, I extracted valuable insights and provided meaningful answers to a few related questions.I consider this as a mini project , did this for practising sql queries.
## Key Highlights:
#### 1) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing : Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in datasets to improve data quality. In this case, the steps outlined, such as removing duplicates, standardizing formats, handling missing or inconsistent values, and creating new columns based on existing ones.Based on the dataset I had I further divided the category column to new columns . Utilized Microsoft Excel for this.
